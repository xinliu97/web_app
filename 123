Dimensionality reduction tab
The project’s objective is to explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA and t-SNE in reducing the dimensionality of complex, multimodal data while preserving essential information and enhancing data visualization.

This project will allow you to apply your knowledge of PCA and t-SNE to a real-world scenario and gain valuable experience in dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It’s an opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity in tackling complex data analysis challenges.

Instructions:

Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
Apply PCA to your record dataset.
Determine the optimal number of principal components to retain.
Visualize the reduced-dimensional data using PCA.
Analyze and interpret the results.
Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE:
Implement t-SNE on the same dataset.
Explore different perplexity values and their impact.
Visualize the t-SNE output to reveal patterns and clusters.
Compare t-SNE results with PCA results.
Evaluation and Comparison:
Evaluate the effectiveness of PCA and t-SNE in terms of preserving data structure and information.
Compare the visualization capabilities of PCA and t-SNE.
Discuss the trade-offs and scenarios where one technique may outperform the other.
Components:

Project Proposal:
A brief proposal outlining your project’s objectives, dataset selection, and the tools or libraries you plan to use (e.g., Python, scikit-learn).
Code Implementation:
Python code for implementing PCA and t-SNE on the selected dataset.
Code should include parameter tuning for t-SNE (perplexity) and visualization of the results.
Project Report:
A comprehensive project report detailing the steps taken, results obtained, and your analysis.
Include visualizations, comparisons, and insights gained from the dimensionality reduction techniques.
